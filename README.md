# Soft Huber Clustering

Implementation of soft clustering using mixtures with log-likelihood inspired by Huber loss function.

In practice, this gives better results than popular KMeans and GaussianMixtures algorithms, built on gaussian modelling.

The api is scikit-learn compatible, a demo with examples is provided as a Colab Notebook.
